# InteriorWebsite
This project is made in support of a small interior decoration business. This website is a complete portfolio of the organization and it includes information about the company and the projects they have dealt with along with their valuable customers feedback.

I have developed this complete portfolio using,
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

And deployed it using GitHub pages!

Kindly feel free to contact the business!

Thank You.
